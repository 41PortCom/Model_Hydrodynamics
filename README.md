# Model_Hydrodynamic
 
  Model.py: A program that calculates the fundamental principles of hydraulics as seen by E. Guyon, J.-P. Hulin, and L. Petit, in "Hydrodynamique Physique. Paris: CNRS Editions, 2001"
  Here we measure the potential velocity field and the pressure field around a cylinder in a flow.
  
  ModelVsMeasurements.py: We place the cylinder in the same conditions as the experiments and the simulation. And we compare.
  The simulation simulates the odd-numbered experiments (i.e., the cylinder's return).

  EXP_1; EXP_2 EXP_3: 3 Experiences with several round trips.
